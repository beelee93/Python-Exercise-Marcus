# Write a function called `diff` that determines the first index when two list differ
# If the lists are the same, then return -1
# Example: 
#   [1,2,3], [1,2,4]    -> 2
#   [5,1], [5,1]        -> -1
#   [0,6,7], [0,6,7,8]  -> 3 (differ by the presence of the 4th element)
#   [0,6,7], [0,0,7,8]  -> 1

def diff(list1, list2):
  return -1
