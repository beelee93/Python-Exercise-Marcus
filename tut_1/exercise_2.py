# Write a program that will calculate the mean test scores for a group of students
# 1. Keeps prompting the user for a name and their test score
# 2. If user types "end", that ends the prompting and begins the calculations
# 3. Print the mean score, and the names of students whose scores at least the mean
#
# Example:
#   "Tim"
#   "80"
#   "Joseph"
#   "60"
#   "Andy"
#   "40"
#   "end"
#   --> Mean: 60, Students with scores >= 60: Tim, Joseph
